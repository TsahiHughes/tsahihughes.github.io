  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>As an Artist I make my Digital Art based off of memories of special people in my life or  special moments i’ve experienced. I love to create Art that can be seen as relaxing to someone, something that you can either listen to and enter a relaxing state or something that you can watch and find it as a sense of relaxation. Part of my process before making my Art is I reminisce about the special events in my life or my current interest or hobbies and i find a way to incorporate it in my art piece. The reasoning behind most of my Art is to show Happiness, Beauty and Patience and maybe even a little Humor. Each Art piece was made on a PC Laptop and was developed using different computer Adobe programs. I enjoy making this type of Art because I want my Art to allow someone to remember a memory that they had of a special moment in their lives or give them a touch of warmth and allow them to enter a different space.</p>
  <p>Most of my Art is made with a purpose or with meaning, some people  might not understand the reasoning behind my Art or what it represents that’s why i made it so that you still get a sense of what i was trying to do even if you don’t know my entire back story on the piece. I want the viewer to be able to remember my art piece as being  a memento in their life to find peace or  joy and be able to enter a relaxing state of mind while experiencing my Art at that moment. Each art piece is a simple memory of mine that gave me joy in my life and i want to be able to share that with others. For the “Vibrant blossom” piece I created this using my own original photo and making my glitch in different computer programs. This piece reminds me of my Great Grandmother and my childhood and how we used to to Plant flowers in her garden when i was a little girl, it represents one of my precious memories and is part of the reason why I wanted to share it with everyone to show a piece of my life that I cherish the most.
